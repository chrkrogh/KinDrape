This folder contains the following files:
1) KinDrape.py (Python implementation of the original MATLAB KinDrape)
2) CallKinDrape.py (script to define input and call KinDrape.py)

The motivation for the Python implementation was to enable users without a MATLAB license
to interact with the kinematic draping code. The code was developed using Python 3.8 and 
can e.g. be executed from the Spyder environment available with the Anaconda distribution 
(https://www.anaconda.com/). Here, interactive plots much like MATLAB are supported.

Please note that the focus in the implementation was to create a code similar in structure 
to the original MATLAB code and therefore not necessarily to create an elegant Python code.
